## 👀 I’m interested in:   
 Building software systems, ML models and research driven problem solving in Computer Science. 

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:  
-> Advanced C++    

-> Machine Learning models (XGBoost, tree-based models, feature engineering)  

-> Data preprocessing, encoding strategies, and model evaluation (RMSE, validation methods)  

-> Web application development and modular system design    

-> Improving time management and structured learning workflows  

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: 

~ Machine learning projects involving real datasets and predictive modeling

~ Web applications, dashboards, and automation tools

~ Open-source contributions related to education, productivity, or data tools

~ Hackathons, research prototypes, and proof-of-concept systems

~ Algorithm practice and coding interview preparation

## 🏛️ Recent Milestones: 

- Worked on a large student performance prediction dataset (~20,000 records), exploring limitations of linear regression and transitioning to more robust ML models

- Strengthened foundational programming skills through algorithm practice and debugging real code issues
